      My Dearest Fari,<br><br>
      Six years… and yet, every memory I’ve made with you still lives fresh and eternal in my heart.
      You were never just someone I loved — you were my peace, my home, my safest place.
      Every piece of love I ever understood came from the way you gave it to me.<br><br>

      I still remember our very first date — Coffeelicious.
      You walked in wearing that stunning black dress, and I swear, time slowed down for a moment.
      My heart was racing with every word you spoke. It was my first date ever, but with you, it felt like a dream.
      You were so elegant, so effortlessly beautiful, and I remember going home that day with butterflies in my chest, replaying every single second of it in my head.
      That was the beginning of everything for me — the start of a love that would grow beyond anything I had ever known.<br><br>
      
      First came Genshin Impact — your favorite game, which became mine too.
      I’ll never forget the love palace you built for us in the Serenitea Pot.
      We posed as Zhongli and Ningguang under that peaceful tree, hugging, smiling, and capturing our little fantasy together.
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      That wasn’t just a virtual world — it was us, holding onto love in the ways we knew how.
      You even gifted me Welkin Moon. Back then, I didn’t thank you the way I should have, and that’s something I’ll always carry with me.
      So let me say it now: Thank you — for your love, your generosity, and the way you showed me affection even when I didn’t know how to receive it right.<br><br>

      And then we created a world together virtually. From watching Splitsvilla, Roadies, laughing and reacting in sync, to those anime, movie nights over Zoom where distance couldn’t take away how close I felt to you — we built something real. Something rare. Something that still lives within me.<br><br>

      And then there was 31st December 2024 — a moment that could’ve gone bad. But you, Fari… you handled it with maturity, patience, and a strength that humbled me.
      After that, our little date at the food court felt like a new beginning — I bought you a balloon, we tried all the food together,
      and in that simple joy, I saw a glimpse of what peace could feel like with you.
      I carry that day in my heart like a quiet promise I still want to fulfill.

    <div class="column">
      But in the same breath, I have to admit — I’ve made mistakes.
      The lie I told about my university still weighs heavily on me. It was wrong.
      I hurt the person who only ever wanted the truth, and I regret it deeply.
      I should’ve trusted you — because you’ve always been more than worthy of honesty and respect.<br><br>

      Despite all of that, you stayed.
      While I was in Malaysia, finishing my Bachelor’s, you remained loyal, faithful, and patient — even though you had every opportunity to walk away, to find someone else in your university back in Bangladesh.
      But you didn’t. You chose me. You held on when I didn’t deserve it, and that is a kind of love I will never be able to thank you enough for.
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      Now, as I prepare to go abroad again to pursue my Master’s, I carry you with me.
      But this time, I’m not just going to study — I’m going to become someone better.
      I want to come back with good grades, with growth, with proof that I’ve become the man who can finally stand beside you.
      I want to be the one your father can look at and say:<br><br>

      “Yes, he is the one who can protect my daughter, love her right, and give her the life she deserves.”<br><br>

      Fari, no matter how many breaks we’ve been through, how distant we’ve become — my heart still knows its way back to you.
      It’s still you.
      It’s always been you.
      And I want it to be you — in this life, and every life after this.<br><br>

      Let’s not throw away what we built. Let’s start again, softer… slower… but stronger than ever.
      Let me prove to you that love isn’t just what we felt before — it’s what we can choose again now.<br><br>

      Forever yours,<br>
      Tazbir
